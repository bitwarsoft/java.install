To install Java on Windows and run Java apps on Microsoftâ€™s operating system, you need to obtain a copy of the Java Development Toolkit (JDK) installation media.

The JDK includes both a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). These are all you need to play games like Minecraft or run applications like NASA World Wind.

The JDK also includes a number of programming tools, like a compiler and a Java web server, for programmers who need to install Java on Windows.
